            <h2>Article</h2>
                <article><p>The LA-based electropop band from Nashville, LANY, have just gifted their fans with a dream-like video for their most popular song yet ‘ILYSB’.

                    The trio Paul Klein, Les Priest and Jake Gross released this track as a part of their first EP, ‘Make Out’ in 2015.  ‘ILYSB’ is an acronym for ‘I love you so bad’ which creates a sick-in-love theme. The lyrics and vocal performance of Paul make me daydream about an obsessive and innocent love that many of us yearn for. "You need to know that I’m hella obsessed with your face” and "Nobody could take your place” signify his mad love or infatuation towards his beloved one.
                    
                    Despite repetitive and slightly obsessive lyrics, I find the song very memorable and optimistic.  
                    
                    Nevertheless, with the help of the video, Klein explains:"I had an opportunity to flip the script, to beautifully blindside the fan and the critic. I turned ‘ILYSB’ into a tragedy of unhealthy obsession and unrequited love that ultimately led to psychotic behaviour and total derailment.”
                    
                    The video itself presents the trio wearing hockey masks while breaking into (supposedly) his ex-girlfriend’s house. Paul sings “oh my heart hurts so good, I love you babe so bad” as he smashes items with a baseball bat furiously. 
                    
                    ‘ILYSB’ takes me to a different world, the world of crazy love and desire of having someone who would be as dedicated to and caring for me as myself towards my beloved one. Very catchy, personable and positive!</p>
                    
                        
                
                    <p>The song "2 Grown" by Lil Tjay featuring The Kid LAROI explores the complexities and challenges of romantic relationships as the artists navigate the transition from adolescence to adulthood. The lyrics convey a sense of disillusionment and a recognition that they are "getting too grown for the childish games" that often accompany youthful relationships.

                        The opening lines sung by Ashley Kutcher set the tone for the song, suggesting a desire for excitement and intensity rather than mundane conversations and emotional attachments. This sets the stage for the theme of falling for strangers and the appeal of dancing with danger.
                        
                        Lil Tjay's verse reflects on the ups and downs of a past relationship, acknowledging the petty arguments and mixed emotions. He expresses a desire to be toxic and hostile, suggesting a willingness to hurt the other person emotionally. This displays a sense of frustration and a desire for control in the dynamic.</p>

                        <article><p>"12 STRONG"</p> 12 Strong (also known as 12 Strong: The Declassified True Story of the Horse Soldiers) is a 2018 American action-war film[4] directed by Nicolai Fuglsig and written by Ted Tally and Peter Craig. The film is based on Doug Stanton's non-fiction book Horse Soldiers, which tells the story of U.S. Army Special Forces sent to Afghanistan immediately after the September 11 attacks. The film stars Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, Michael Peña, Navid Negahban, Trevante Rhodes, Geoff Stults, Thad Luckinbill, Ben O'Toole, William Fichtner, and Rob Riggle.
                
                            Principal photography began in January 2017 in New Mexico. The film was released in the United States on January 19, 2018, by Warner Bros. Pictures, in standard and IMAX theaters. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the cast and action but criticized the by-the-numbers execution and lack of hindsight of the War in Afghanistan.[5]
